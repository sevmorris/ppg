# release.sh — Build, verify, package, and publish a Perfect Passwords Grabber
# release.
#
# Usage: ./release.sh <version> [--generated-notes] [--skip-tests]
#   e.g. ./release.sh 1.8
#
# Requires: swift, hdiutil, gh (GitHub CLI), git, codesign, xcrun, plutil,
#   security, and python3 with dmgbuild; preflight checks each.
#
# A Swift package, not an Xcode project: swift builds the binary, and this
# script assembles the app bundle around it. Until 1.7 that was distribute.sh,
# which built, signed and notarized a DMG and left tagging, pushing and the
# GitHub release to be done by hand. This is the sibling apps' release.sh,
# ported from Barkeep's, with every guard they carry.
