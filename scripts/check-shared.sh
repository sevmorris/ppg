# Shared verbatim across the sibling app repos (DoublEnder, WaxOnWaxOff,
# ClipHack, FilmStrip, KeyVault, Magic Backup Machine, Barkeep, PasswordGen).
# Keep the copies byte-identical: scripts/check-shared.sh compares them and a
# release preflight fails when they drift. Anything app-specific belongs in
# that repo's release.sh, not here.
#
# Reports files that are meant to be identical across the sibling repos but
# are not. These projects are deliberately independent — there is no shared
# package — so the copies are vendored, and the failure mode is silent drift:
# a fix lands in one repo and the others keep the bug. That is not
# hypothetical. The FFmpeg process hardening landed in WaxOnWaxOff and not in
# ClipHack, and two latent crashes sat there until an audit found them.
#
# Registration is by marker, not by manifest, so there is no list to forget to
# update: a file joins the set by carrying the header comment above (its own
# first line quoted below). To share a new file, copy it to the siblings with
# that header.
#
# Copies are paired by filename, not by path: the same Swift file lives under
# WaxOnWaxOff/Services in one repo and ClipHackKit/Services in the other, and
# neither layout is wrong. Two marked files sharing a basename inside one repo
# would make that pairing meaningless, so it is reported as an error.
#
# A sibling that is missing, or that does not carry a given file, is reported
# and skipped — DoublEnder has no Swift sources to share. A content mismatch or
# an ambiguous pairing fails. So does comparing nothing while siblings are
# checked out, since each of them carries at least this script. With no sibling
# checked out at all — a fresh clone — the check passes, but says it compared
# nothing rather than printing a clean count of zero: a check looking in the
# wrong directory prints that too, and on 2026-09-24 one did.
